== RAP PDE Build build example ==

This repository contains one bundle (which contains a RAP application) and one feature to 
demonstrate how to build a RAP application with PDE Build. The build will be done with the
artifacts in the com.eclipsesource.maildemo.PDEBuild.releng project.

=== Usage ===

* Clone the repository and switch to the repository/PDEBuild/com.eclipsesource.maildemo.PDEBuild.releng 
  folder via the command line.
* Run the build.sh script with the following arguments:
  --runtimeDir "Absolute path to an Eclipse installation containing the PDE Build Plug-In"
  --targetDir "Absolute path to a RAP Target Platform containing RAP and the Equinox SDK" 
* After the build has succeeded you will find a maildemo.war in the 
  com.eclipsesource.maildemo.PDEBuild.releng/build/out folder.
* Deploy the maildemo.war to the servlet container of your choice.
